# recipes-manager-react-app

No optimization of image loading (lazy loading) was implemented therefore it could be slower if the internet connection is not good. It is something that I will implement, though.

This app was deployed on Netlify: the link to the website can be found on the right, or [here](https://elisa-recipe-manager.netlify.app/)
